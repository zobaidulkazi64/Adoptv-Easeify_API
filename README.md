# Pet Adoption and Rescue Platform

## Overview

The Pet Adoption and Rescue Platform is a web application designed to facilitate the adoption process for pets in need of homes. It serves as a marketplace where rescue organizations can list pets available for adoption, and potential adopters can browse listings, submit applications, and connect with rescue organizations.

## Application Functionalities

1. **User Service**:

   - Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management for adopters and rescue organizations.

2. **Pet Listing Service**:

   - Allows rescue organizations to list pets available for adoption with detailed information such as species, breed, age, and photos.

3. **Adoption Application Service**:

   - Enables adopters to apply for adopting pets listed on the platform.
   - Facilitates the review and processing of adoption applications by rescue organizations.

4. **Notification Service**:
   - Sends notifications to users about new pet listings, application status updates, and other relevant events.

## Communication Patterns

- **Synchronous**: Utilizes HTTP endpoints for user management, pet listings, and adoption applications.
- **Asynchronous**: Implements RabbitMQ for sending notifications to users and processing adoption applications in the background.

## Data Caching

- Utilizes Redis for caching frequently accessed data such as pet listings and user profiles to improve system performance.

## Rate Limiting

- Implements rate limiting to manage incoming requests effectively, especially for high-traffic endpoints like pet listings and adoption applications.

## API Gateway/Reverse Proxy

- Develops a custom API gateway to handle authentication, route requests to appropriate microservices, and ensure secure communication between clients and services.

## Containerization and Deployment

- Utilizes Docker for containerization, with Dockerfiles for each microservice to ensure consistency across different environments.
- Deploys containers using Docker Compose for local development and Kubernetes for production to ensure scalability and ease of management.

## CI/CD Pipelines

- Sets up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions for automated testing, building Docker images, and deploying changes to production.
- Includes automated tests for each microservice to ensure reliability and stability throughout the development lifecycle.

## Documentation

- Provides comprehensive design diagrams illustrating the microservices architecture, data flow, and communication patterns within the platform.
- Writes detailed documentation explaining each microservice's functionality, API endpoints, dependencies, and deployment instructions.

By adhering to these project requirements, the Pet Adoption and Rescue Platform aims to streamline the pet adoption process, connect adopters with pets in need of homes, and provide a user-friendly experience for both adopters and rescue organizations.
